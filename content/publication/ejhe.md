abstract = "Length of stay (LOS) in hospital for inpatient treatment is a measure of crucial recovery time. Using nationwide data on inpatient healthcare in India, a three-component finite mixture negative binomial model was found to provide a reasonable fit to the heterogeneous LOS distribution. Associated risk factors for short-stay, medium-stay and long-stay subgroups were identified from the respective negative binomial components. In addition, significant heterogeneities within each group were also found."
abstract_short = "A finit mixture model has been fitted to to the duration of stay in hospital. The model has identified three different groups of inpatients on the basis of background characteristics and hospital related factors to understand the heterogeneity in length of stay."
