abstract = "This paper examines the rich–poor gap in antenatal and delivery care in Northeast India on the basis of household economic well-being index constructed from household amenities, housing quality, consumer durables owned and assets. The study uses data on frequency of antenatal checks, iron folic supplementation, receiving two doses of tetanus toxoid injection and skill of delivery attendant from the Indian National Family Health Survey-II (1998–99). The finding reveals an unimaginably low level of maternal care in the region. Besides, there is evidence of concentration of women without adequate maternal care amongst the poorest economic strata. The need for region specific equitable maternal care services is suggested for the inaccessible northeastern region of India."
